An object is anything that really exists in the world and can be distingusihed from other.
Every object has some behaviour that is characterized by attributes and actions. Attributes are represented
by variables and actions are performed by the methods. So an object contains variables and methods.

function written inside a class is method.

A class is a model or blueprint for creating objects. A class also contains varibales and methods

An object cannot exist without the class but class can exist without an object.

Encapsulation is a mechanism where the data (variables) and the code (methods) that act on
the data will bind together.  Ex. class is an example of encapsulation

Hiding unnecessary data and code from the user is abstraction. This is done by writing two underscores before
the names of the variables or method.

private members can be accessed using 'name mangling' where the class name is used with single underscore it and
two underscores after it in the form of
    instancename._Classname__variable
    instancename._Classname__method

procedure oriented approach - procedure and functions
Object oriented approach - classes and object

python can be writen in Procedure oriented approach or Object oriented approach, based on requirements
